### 1.Display the first 10 rows of the dataset using RMarkdown .
```{r}
library(knitr)
thanksgiving%>%head(10)%>%kable()

```

### 2.Use `fct_reorder` and `parse_number` functions to create a factor variable `family_income`
```{r}
thanksgiving%>%mutate(family_income = fct_reorder(family_income,parse_number(family_income)))
```

### 3.Generate the general statistics of the dataset using `summary()` and `skim()` function
```{r}
library(skimr)
thanksgiving%>%
  summary(thanksgiving)
  skim(thanksgiving)
```

### 4. What is the number of people who celebrate?
```{r}
thanksgiving%>%
  count(celebrate,sort = TRUE) %>%
  kable()
```
The number of people who celebrate is 980.


### 5.What are categories and stats for each main dish served and the method it is prepared?
```{r}
thanksgiving%>%
  count(main_dish,main_prep, sort = TRUE) %>%
  kable()
```
### 6. Create a data viz showing this in the most evident way. Provide your own legend and use themes.
library(ggplot2)
```{r}
thanksgiving%>%
  count(main_dish, main_prep, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(main_dish, n, fill = main_prep)) +
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(x = 'Type of Main Dish', y = 'Number of Item', title = 'Method of having meals', caption = 'Image : Graph') +
  theme_linedraw()

```

### 7. How many use cranberry sauce? How many use gravy?

library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)


```{r}
thanksgiving%>%
  count(cranberry,sort = TRUE)%>%
  filter(cranberry == "Canned" | cranberry == "Homemade")
```

```{r}
thanksgiving%>%
count(gravy)%>%
  filter(gravy == "Yes")

```
Cranberry:502+301=803 & Gravy:892

### 8 & 9.What is the distribution of those who celebrate across income ranges.Presnet this information in the most evident way on the data viz.

```{r}
thanksgiving%>%
count(celebrate, family_income) %>%
  filter(celebrate == "Yes" ) %>%
  group_by(family_income) %>%
  ggplot(aes(family_income, n, fill = celebrate)) +
  geom_col()+
  coord_flip()+
  labs(x = "Income Range", y="Number of people", title = "Who want to celebrate the Thanksgiving", caption = "Image 2: Graph") +
  theme_test()
```
### 10.What are the most common pies, sides, and desserts?
```{r}
Most_common_pie <- thanksgiving %>%
  gather("famous", "famouspie", starts_with("pie"))%>%
  filter(!is.na(famouspie)) %>%
  count(famouspie = fct_lump(famouspie, 1), sort = TRUE)%>%
  mutate(famouspie = fct_reorder(famouspie, n))
```

```{r}
Most_common_side <- thanksgiving %>%
  gather("famous", "famousside", starts_with("side"))%>%
  filter(!is.na(famousside)) %>%
  count(famousside = fct_lump(famousside, 1), sort = TRUE)%>%
  mutate(famousside = fct_reorder(famousside, n))
```

```{r}
Most_common_dessert <- thanksgiving %>%
  gather("famous", "famousdessert", starts_with("dessert"))%>%
  filter(!is.na(famousdessert)) %>%
  count(famousdessert = fct_lump(famousdessert, 1), sort = TRUE)%>%
  mutate(famousdessert = fct_reorder(famousdessert, n))
```

### 11.Present this information on a data viz

```{r}
ggplot(Most_common_side,aes(famousside, n))+
  geom_col()+
  theme_light() 
  
```
```{r}
ggplot(Most_common_dessert,aes(famousdessert, n))+
  geom_col()+
  theme_light() 
  
```
```{r}
ggplot(Most_common_pie,aes(famouspie, n))+
  geom_col()+
  theme_light() 
  
```
 
 
### 13 & 14. How do the servings differ by income? Present this information on a data viz

```{r}
thanksgiving%>% filter(main_dish != 'None' , main_dish != 'Other (please specify)') %>% count(main_dish, family_income) %>%
  ggplot(aes(main_dish, n)) + 
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(legend.position = 'none') +
  labs(x= 'Dishes Type', y= 'Frequency of how those dishes are prepared', title = 'The most common way that Thanksgiving meals are prepared', caption = 'Graph type: point')

```
